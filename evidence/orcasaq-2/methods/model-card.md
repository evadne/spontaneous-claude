OrcaSAQ2 is a proprietary **sensitivity-aware mixed-precision quantization system** developed by OrcaRouter and its research team behind.

It is optimized around one goal: **Preserve as much useful model behavior as possible inside a practical GPU memory envelope.**

The resulting checkpoint provides:
- **77.2% smaller storage footprint**
- only **+0.02% perplexity** versus BF16
- **93.2% token-level Top-1 agreement**
- **0.031 mean KLD**
- **262K context**
- thinking mode
- tool calling
- MTP speculative decoding
- production serving through **vLLM**

## BF16 fidelity

All numbers below are measured using **these exact OrcaSAQ2 weights** against the BF16 reference through the same evaluation path.

### WikiText-2

**16,376 predicted tokens**

| Build | Size | Decoder Bits | Mean KLD ↓ | Top-1 Agreement ↑ | PPL ↓ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.8-27B BF16 | 54 GB | 16 | — | 100% | 5.6468 |
| **OrcaSAQ2 27B** | **12.3 GB** | **3.21** | **0.031** | **93.2%** | **5.6482** |

### Perplexity

### Top-1 agreement

```

**77.2% smaller.**

---

## Long-horizon agents

### Low-bit fidelity matters more as the horizon grows.

Short benchmarks can hide small degradation.

Agents cannot.

A small model error can change a tool call.

That changes the environment state.

The changed state affects every decision that follows.

```text
Plan
  ↓
Act
  ↓
Observe
  ↓
Decide
  ↓
Recover
  ↓
Repeat
  ↓
...
  ↓
Task Success
```

Across long trajectories, small errors can compound into large behavioral differences.

That makes long-horizon execution an especially useful stress test for compressed reasoning models.

OrcaSAQ2 performs **strongly on long-horizon workloads relative to models in its deployment and parameter class**, despite operating from a **12.3 GB checkpoint**.

This makes it particularly suitable for:

- coding agents
- terminal agents
- browser agents
- computer-use agents
- security agents
- repository-scale tasks
- multi-tool workflows
- failure recovery
- long-running stateful execution

### Why this matters

Perplexity asks:

> **How similar is the next-token distribution?**

Long-horizon evaluation asks:

> **Can the model still finish the job after many decisions?**

For agent models, both matter.

## Long-horizon performance

Agent benchmarks depend heavily on the surrounding scaffold, tools, reasoning
budget, timeouts and execution environment. The results below are therefore
shown as **public reference points, not direct apples-to-apples comparisons**.

#### SWE-bench Verified

| Model | Reported score |
|---|---:|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 79.6 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 77.2 |
| Gemini 3 | 76.2 |
| **OrcaSAQ2 27B** | **70.0** |
| Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B | 69.6 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 63.8 |
| GPT-4.1 | 54.6 |

**70.0% SWE-bench Verified from a 12.06 GB 27B checkpoint.**

#### Terminal-Bench 2.1

| Model / Agent | Reported score |
|---|---:|
| Gemini 3.1 Pro / Terminus 2 | 70.7 |
| Claude Opus 4.6 / Claude Code | 70.1 |
| Claude Opus 4.6 / Terminus 2 | 63.8 |

| Gemini 3 Flash / Gemini CLI | 56.9 |
| GPT-5.4 / Terminus 2 | 54.8 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Terminus 2 | 51.5 |

**58.4% Terminal-Bench 2.1 while fitting in ~12 GB of checkpoint storage.**

> Public scores use different agent stacks and should not be interpreted as a
> strict model-only ranking.

## Production serving

### Up to 90.1 tok/s single-stream on a 16 GB GPU

Measured under a **15.7 GiB GPU memory cap**.

| Configuration | 1 Stream | 8 Streams | 16 Streams | KV Pool |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| vLLM · MTP off | 65.3 tok/s | **332 tok/s** | **333 tok/s** | 29,354 tok |
| **vLLM · MTP on** | **90.1 tok/s** | 220 tok/s | 219 tok/s | 14,563 tok |

### MTP speculative decoding

```text
Single-stream decode

MTP off    █████████████████████████████       65.3 tok/s

MTP on     ████████████████████████████████████████
                                                90.1 tok/s
```

**+38% single-stream decode throughput**

MTP trades additional compute and KV capacity for stronger interactive decode performance.

It is particularly useful for:

- coding assistants
- interactive agents
- terminal agents
- tool-heavy applications
- low-concurrency inference

For highly batched workloads, benchmark both configurations.

## 27B on a 16 GB GPU

OrcaSAQ2's checkpoint is **12.3 GB**.

That makes deployment possible on hardware that cannot hold the original 54 GB BF16 checkpoint.

```text
16 GB GPU
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                           │
│   OrcaSAQ2 weights          12.3 GB       │
│   ███████████████████████████████████     │
│                                           │
│   Remaining               ~3.7 GB         │
│   ██████████                              │
│                                           │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Actual usable memory depends on:

- vLLM overhead
- KV-cache configuration
- MTP
- batch size
- context length
- CUDA graph configuration

A practical starting point for a 16 GB GPU is approximately **32K interactive context**, then tune based on the workload.

The model architecture supports up to **262K context**.

```

---

### Download

```bash
hf download orcarouter/OrcaSAQ2-27B \
  --local-dir ./OrcaSAQ2-27B

## OpenAI-compatible API

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="not-needed",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="OrcaSAQ2-27B",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Analyze this repository and plan the next five actions."
        }
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

## Recommended sampling

```text
temperature = 1.0
top_p       = 0.95
top_k       = 20
```

Thinking mode is enabled by default.

For agent deployments, benchmark against the actual tool schema, context distribution and reasoning budget used in production.

---

## Evaluation philosophy

A low-bit reasoning model should not be judged by checkpoint size alone.

We look at the intersection of:

<p align="center"><strong>Footprint × BF16 Fidelity × Capability × Long-Horizon Stability × Serving Performance</strong></p>

A useful low-bit model must remain useful after compression.

---

## Why perplexity alone is not enough

Perplexity is useful and reproducible.

It is not a complete measure of agentic capability.

Quantization can affect:

```text
reasoning
   ↓
planning
   ↓
tool selection
   ↓
state tracking
   ↓
recovery
   ↓
task completion
```

That is why OrcaSAQ2 reports BF16 fidelity metrics alongside downstream and long-horizon evaluation.

---

## Method

OrcaSAQ2 uses a proprietary **sensitivity-aware mixed-precision quantization system** developed by OrcaRouter.

The implementation is optimized to preserve model quality under a strict deployment-memory target.

Detailed quantization methodology, calibration strategy, precision allocation and packing techniques are not currently disclosed.

---

## Limitations

- OrcaSAQ2 inherits the capabilities, biases and limitations of Qwen3.8-27B.
- Quantization is not mathematically lossless.
- **93.2% Top-1 agreement** means some token decisions differ from BF16.
- **+0.02% PPL** is a model-fidelity measurement and does not guarantee identical downstream performance.
- Long-horizon comparisons should use a controlled same-harness evaluation.
- This checkpoint is **text-only**.
- The vision tower is not included.
- OrcaSAQ2 requires the OrcaSAQ2 vLLM integration.
- Maximum architectural context does not imply that the full context fits into every GPU memory envelope.
